## System Requirements

The following software must be installed on your system before installing the the giveaway automator script.

### Google Chrome + Tampermonkey

Make sure to use the [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/) web browser and ensure you have the [Tampermonkey extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) installed.  Tampermonkey is safe to use and is a robust grease monkey scripting toolkit.

## Installation

To install Amazon Giveaway Automator, click [here](https://github.com/pradeep-kumar-yarra/amazon-giveaway-automator/blob/master/amazonGiveawayAutomator.user.js). If Tampermonkey is correctly installed, you will be asked to add the script to your dashboard. Confirm the installation and start winning some giveaways.

## Usage

Once installed, ensure Tampermonkey is enabled and navigate to [Amazon Giveaways](https://www.amazon.com/ga/giveaways). A control panel will show up under the search bar. Click "Start Automator" and a new window will open and begin automating your giveaway entries. Enter your email if you wish, I am not associated with the server that sends the email. But from my usage I have not had any problems or junk sent to me from it.
Also, you can open multiple windows and have them running the script so long as you don't close the original. Keep them in their own screen and don't have any in full screen since it will pause script execution while you aren't focused on that screen.
